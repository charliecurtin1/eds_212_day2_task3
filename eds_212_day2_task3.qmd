section 3: derivatives in R

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

derivative expression and slope at the indicated value

1.  Find the slope of f(x) = x^2^ at x = 3

2.  Find the slope of P(a) = 2(3a + 2)^4^ -5 at a = 1.2

```{r}
fx = expression(x ^ 2)

dfdx = D(fx, 'x')

dfdx

x = 3

eval(dfdx)
```

```{r}
pa = expression(2 * (3 * a + 2) ^ 4 - 5)

dpda = D(pa, 'a')

dpda

a = 1.2

eval(dpda)
```
