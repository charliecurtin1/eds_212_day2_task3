section 3: derivatives in R

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

derivative expression and slope at the indicated value

1.  Find the slope of f(x) = x^2^ at x = 3

2.  Find the slope of P(a) = 2(3a + 2)^4^ -5 at a = 1.2

```{r}
fx = expression(x ^ 2)

dfdx = D(fx, 'x')

dfdx

x = 3

eval(dfdx)
```

```{r}
pa = expression(2 * (3 * a + 2) ^ 4 - 5)

dpda = D(pa, 'a')

dpda

a = 1.2

eval(dpda)
```

section 4: make another penguin plot

x= bill length, y = bill depth

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

flipper length by species

x = species, y = flipper length

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = species)) +
  geom_jitter(color = 'green') +
  labs(x = "flipper length", y = "species", title = "flipper length by species")
```
